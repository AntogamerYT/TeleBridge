# TeleBridge
A Telegram-Discord bridge!


## How to run
### You should install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to continue (latest version recommended)
- Clone the repo
- Create a [Discord bot](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and a Telegram bot by messaging [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), MAKE SURE TO DISABLE PRIVACY MODE by following this video ![](https://cdn.antogamer.it/r/Telegram_LcLzXfxwXO.gif)
- Fill out the [.env.example](https://github.com/AntogamerYT/TeleBridge/blob/master/.env.example) and rename it into `.env`
- Run `npm install` to install the required packages
- Run `node .` and (if everything is done correctly) the bot will be up and ready to use!
